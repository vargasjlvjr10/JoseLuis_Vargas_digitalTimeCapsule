        <h2>About Him</h2>
        <p>
            Meet Jose! He recently became 21 years old and he resides in the city of San Jose. He has never lived anywhere else other than this city and he's fine with that because he truly enjoys the city he grew up in. Both of his parents immigrated together from the small town of Amacueca, Jalisco located in Mexico. Jose went back to revisit Mexico for the first time when he turned 18. Some of his favorite colors are green, brown, and purple. You will often see him wearing these colors - and if not, hes probably wearing black instead. Something that truly defines him is his deep connection with the natural world. If it wasn't for the pine-filled landscape surrounding I-280 on his commute to San Francisco, he probably wouldn't be here today. (He crashed his car from boredom). Jose's heart belongs to nature; it's where he finds solace and adventure. When he steps into the woods or strolls by a babbling stream, he's in his element. Beyond the wilderness, Jose's appetite for life extends to dining out with his friends. Exploring new restaurants is his passion. He savors the thrill of trying diverse cuisines and sharing delightful moments with his friends.
