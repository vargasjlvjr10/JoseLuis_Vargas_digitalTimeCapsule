# The Digital Time Capsule

## Project Overview

In a rapidly digitizing world, our online presence has become an extension of ourselves. From our social media interactions to the content we consume, our digital footprint forms a unique tapestry that reflects our likes, interests, and activities. This project, the Digital Self-Portrait Website, invites you to explore and showcase my digital identity through the creation of a personalized three-page website.


## Technical Overview

Creating my Digital Self-Portrait Website involves a blend of front-end web development technologies and creative design elements. 

### HTML and CSS
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of the website. It defines the structure and content of web pages. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the layout, styling, and visual presentation of the site.

HTML will be used to structure the pages, create links, and embed media elements. CSS will be employed for styling, ensuring that the website is visually appealing and user-friendly.
